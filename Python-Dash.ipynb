    "## Layout\n",
    "- Defines the layout of the app: what it looks like\n",
    "- Dash provides classes for all of the visual components of the app\n",
    "- Components\n",
    "    - A set is created/maintained by dash\n",
    "        - `dash_core_components` and `dash_html_components` libraries\n",
    "    - Can build your own with JS and React.js\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Layout Notes (see `app.py` file in `First_Dash_App`)\n",
    "1. The `layout` is composed of a tree of 'components' like `html.Div` and `dcc.Graph`\n",
    "2. The `dash_html_components` library has a component for every HTML tag\n",
    "    - The `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` component generates a `<h1>Hello Dash</h1>` HTML element in the app\n",
    "3. Not all components are pure HTML\n",
    "    - The `dash_core_components` library describes higher-level components that are interactive and generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library\n",
    "4. Each component is described entirely through keyword attributes\n",
    "    - Dash is *declarative*: you will primarily describe your app through these attributes\n",
    "5. The `children` property is special\n",
    "    - By convention, it's the first attribute, and you can't omit it\n",
    "    - `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` = `html.H1('Hello Dash')`\n",
    "    - Can be a string, number, a single component, or a list of components\n",
    "6. Visit the [css tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/external-resources) for more info on creating style sheets\n",
    "7. 'Hot Reloading'\n",
    "    - New to dash 0.30.0 and dash-renderer 0.15.0\n",
    "    - Activated by default when you run `app.run_server(debug=True)` in the main function call"
