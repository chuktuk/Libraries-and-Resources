    "    - where did the data come from, and what are you missing\n",
    "    - your sample vs. the population\n",
    "- Publication Bias\n",
    "    - only positive/significant results published\n",
    "    - highly influence by $\\alpha < 0.05$ threshold\n",
    "- Non-Response Bias\n",
    "    - people did/didn't respond are different\n",
    "- Length Bias\n",
    "    - especially important with time based measurements\n",
    "    - bias towards individuals (data points) that remain in a specific state longer\n",
    "        - you miss the two day sample and collect the 20 yr sample, this happens repeatedly\n",
    "- Calculation\n",
    "    - difference between your estimation and the \"truth\"\n",
    "        - almost impossible to find the \"truth\", so really can't calculate bias accurately\n",
    "- MSE (meas squared error)\n",
    "    - $MSE = variance + bias^2$\n",
    "    - decreasing bias often means taking more samples or increasing model complexity, which means increasing variance\n",
    "    - it's a tradeoff, and decreasing bias may increase variance enough to make the MSE very large\n",

    "        - past reliability, known biases, etc.\n",
    "- Bonferroni Correction\n",
