    "## Markdown\n",
    "- To change a cell to markdown, use the dropdown select box or 'cell'->'cell type' from the menu\n",
    "- Create Headings\n",
    "    - use one `#` for HTML style H1\n",
    "    - use two `##` for H2, and so on\n",
    "- Create bullet/numbered lists\n",
    "    - use \\- or \\* to start a list\n",
    "    - indent then use \\- or \\* to do subsets\n",
    "    - use a number, period, space to do a numbered list, and indent for mulitple levels\n",
    "    - only one primary list type per cell, but secondary levels can be bullets or numbers\n",
    "- Escape character\n",
    "    - use \\\\ or sometimes \\\\\\\\ to escape certain chars and display them\n",
    "    - can also use monospace font to display special chars\n",
    "- Monospace font\n",
    "    - to make monospace font, put text between back single quote mark (same key as ~)\n",
    "    - use `monospace` for files, paths, text users should enter, or messages text users see\n",
    "- Mimic code of a language\n",
    "    - to make a formatted code block\n",
    "        - three back ticks and the language name on the first line\n",
    "        - write your code block formatted properly with new lines and indents\n",
    "        - place three back ticks on the line underneath your code block\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
    "            print('index: ', index, ', value: ', value)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "- Bold/italic text\n",
    "    - use \\*\\***for bold**\\*\\*\n",
    "    - use \\**for italic*\\*\n",
    "    - use \\ to escape the \\* char and output it\n",
    "- Horizontal lines\n",
    "    - three \\* symbols, and it spans the entire width of the window\n",
    "***\n",
    "- Geometric shapes\n",
    "    - use \"\\&\\#reference_number;\"\n",
    "    - Visit  [UTF-8 Geometric Shapes](https://tinyurl.com/y5amtg8v) for codes from w3schools.com\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "    - you can drag/drop images into markdown cells\n",
    "    - use <img=src alt= title= /> html code to add images to other cell types\n",
    "- Internal links\n",
    "    - `[section title](#section-title)`\n",
    "        - or\n",
    "    - add `<a id=\"section_id\"></a>` right above section title\n",
    "    - then `[section title](#section_id)`\n",
    "- External links\n",
    "    - use `[link text](url)`\n",
    "- Mathematical symbols\n",
    "    - put math symbols between `$math goes here$`\n",
    "    - escaping dollar signs appears to be tricky in the same cell, but can do once with two \\\\\n",
    "    - $2 + 2 = 4$\n",
    "- Line breaks\n",
    "    - use the HTML `<br>` to force a line break\n",
    "- Indent quoting\n",
    "    - type the \\> char, a space, then your text\n",
