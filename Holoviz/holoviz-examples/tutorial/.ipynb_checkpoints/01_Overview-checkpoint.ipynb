We first look at [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org) package, which works with nearly any plotting library, then [hvPlot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org), which works with nearly any data library and shares an API with many other plotting libraries, and then dive deeper into HoloViz-specific approaches that let you work with large data, provide deep interactivity, and other advanced features."
