    "hvPlot and HoloViews support even high-dimensional datasets easily, and the standard mechanisms discussed already work well as long as you select a small enough subset of the data to display at any one time.  However, some datasets are just inherently large, even for a single frame of data, and cannot safely be transferred for display in any standard web browser. Luckily, HoloViews makes it simple for you to use the separate [Datashader](http://datashader.readthedocs.io) library together with any of the plotting extension libraries it supports, including Bokeh and Matplotlib. Datashader is designed to complement standard plotting libraries by providing faithful visualizations for very large datasets, focusing on revealing the overall distribution, not just individual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datashader uses computations accelerated using [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org), making it fast to work with datasets of millions or billions of datapoints stored in [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) dataframes.  Dask dataframes provide an API that is functionally equivalent to Pandas, but allows working with data out of core and scaling out to many processors across compute clusters. Here we will use Dask to load and visualize the entire earthquake dataset.\n",
