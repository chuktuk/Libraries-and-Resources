This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

# Variables
You can use '=' or the assignment operator <- to define variables.
Variable names can include `.` in them
```{r}
c <- 4
b = 2
d = c * b
d
```

# Logical operators are the same as python
`==`
`!=`
`>`
`<`
`>=`
`<=`
```{r}
b > c
```
# Strings
```{r}
s <- 'This is a string.'
t <- "So is this."
print(s)
print(t)
```



# Mathematical operations
`sqrt(x)` -- if multiple items, will sqrt all of them
`log(x)`
`sum(x, y)` -- sums all numbers within
`mean(x, y,...)`
`length(x, y, ...)` returns the number of objects in ()
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(length(a))
```


# Basic Commands
Single line comments # just like python
Multi-line comments in R studio Ctrl + Shift + C
`c(....)` concatenates objects separated by commas
```{r}
# this is a single line comment
```

# IMPORTANT
R is 1 indexed!
```{r}
print(a[3])
```

# Dataframes
Access columns using `$` e.g. `df.name$column.name`
`rownames(df)` will return all of the row names in a df

`data()` can be used to load a dataframe that comes with R
- `data(iris)` for example

## Selecting df elements
Like python (except 1 indexed)
`df[1, 2]` gets the first row, second column
- can also use this to assign values `df[1, 2] <- 100`
`df[4,]` selects entire 4th row, same idea for columns, but usually would just use column name for that

## Basic exploratory functions
`names(df)` lists all of the column names
`unique(selection)` will list all of the unique items in the specified selection `unique(df[,2])`

## Basic plots
`plot(df)` will do a pairplot of all of the variables
`plot(df$y.var ~ df$x.var)` for basic plots

```{r}

```


# Lattice Library
`library(lattice)` to load libraries

See example plot below

```{r}
data(iris)
library(lattice)
scatter1 <- xyplot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, group=Species, data=iris)
print(scatter1)
```


# Missing Values
`na.rm = True` works for many functions, and this just omits those values



# Conditionals

syntax is below
```{r}
if (b > c) {
  print('B is greater')
} else if (b == c) {
  print('B equals C')
} else if (c > b) {
  print('C is greater')
} else print('Nonsense')
```

# Conditionals as selectors
- can use as a selection mask just like python
`T` is used for True
`F` is used for False
```{r}
sel <- c(T, T, F, T, T)
print(a[sel])
sel2 <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)
print(a[sel2])
sel3 <- c('True', 'True', 'False', 'True', 'True')
print(a[sel3])
sel4 <- c(True, True, False, True, False)
print(a[sel4])
```

can use complex masks
```{r}
mask <- (iris[,2] > 3) & (iris[,5] == 'setosa')
iris[mask,]
```
